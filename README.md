# Building and Testing with Gradle

This project is the result of working through the O'Reilly eBook *Building and Testing with Gradle*. Gradle provides the eBook for free on its website [here](https://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle-java/). 

This project is not intended for public consumption.  You are much better off working directly with the book itself.  This is mainly just a means of keeping myself organized and maintaining a public record of the technologies I learn/work with.
